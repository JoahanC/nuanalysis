The file contains basic information regarding the usage of the 
classes in this repository and all of the relating testing 
scripts. The repository contains scripts that are intended 
for beginning time-series analysis of NuSTAR observations of 
faint FOV X-ray transients.

The main file in this repository is the nuanalysis.py. This 
contains the `NuAnalysis` class which builds off of the python 
classes included in nustar_gen_utils. The methods of this class 
comprise of all of the different analysis routines that are 
build into this repository. 

# Initializing the class

This class assumes that the NuSTAR data that you are using is 
in a folder labeled by its NuSTAR sequence id. If clean events 
files are not present in the sequence id folder, then the class 
will automatically run `nupipeline` to generate clean event files.
