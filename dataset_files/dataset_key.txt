In this folder are several iterations of the transient search that were conducted on the 11 year data. 
The most recent datasets are those listed as ssd*_poisson_*_final.tbl, these datasets have corrected 
poisson statistics. The numbers 500/1000/5000 refer to the characteristic timescale for each transient 
search.

The ssd* labels on each file refer to a personal naming convention as the data needed to be split into two 
storage components, so the complete dataset refers to both the ssd1 and ssd2 data tables.

In each table are flagged pixels which were calculated to have a statistically significant transient event. 
The main source has been masked out of each NuSTAR data observation to reduce the number of false detections, 
but there is still a significant amount of false detections attributed to straylight, as well as some PSF 
bleeding from the main source. For each flagged pixel, the sequence id corresponding to its observation is attached, as well 
as its attributed poisson statistic probability, the time interval at which it occured in the observation, and the 
energy channel to which it belongs to.
